Vercel's home for GTM Feedback collection, reporting, and action

-> https://gtmfeedback.vercel.app/ (only accessible to Vercel employees)

The app and its database are private, but the frontend code is open source -- we think *every* GTM org should be scalably capturing and surfacing product feedback!

Vercelians, see [this internal primer](https://www.notion.so/vercel/GTMFeedback-vercel-app-Contribution-Primer-257e06b059c480099ab8f9a49c1a62e0) for contribution guidelines.
